## Overview

This one was fairly easy to finish. I think I've grown past all the newbie challenges, but each one still has one thing that causes me to take a bit more time to finish the challenge. So I'm thinking I'll finish them all.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned I should try to use flex a bit more. I wanted the bottom two containers to each take up space until they could wrap, but I forgot to set the flex shrink part of the flex property to 1.

### Continued development

Still want to get better at Grid & Flex. Trying to be the Kevin Powell of CSS one day.
